## Contents

 This addon adds 2 Classes (`ActionIcon` and `ActionIconTextureRect`) to the tree and a Object class (`ActionIconGlobal`)

* `ActionIconGlobal`
  * Its sole purpose is to provide static functions, this way you can call `ActionIconGlobal.*` similar to an autoload (without being one)
* `ActionIcon` and `ActionIconTextureRect`
  * They are `Sprite2D` and `TextureRect` respectively as premade classes to ease common use cases. They both are essentially the same
